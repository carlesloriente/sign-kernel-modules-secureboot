# Contributing to sign-kernel-modules-secureboot

:tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation and submitting bug reports to writing code that can be incorporated into this project.

## Reporting bugs

Did you find a bug?

- Do not open a GitHub issue directly if the bug is a security vulnerability; check the [security policy][1].
- Ensure the bug still needs to be reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues][2].
- If you cannot find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible demonstrating the expected behaviour.

## Suggesting features/enhancements

Feature requests are always welcome.

Open an issue on our [issues list on GitHub][2], describing the feature you want to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Pull requests

Code changes and pull requests from the community are welcome. Patches, improvements, and new features in pull requests will significantly help me.
